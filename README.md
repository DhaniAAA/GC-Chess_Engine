## 🔧 Building

### Requirements

- **C++17** compatible compiler:
  - GCC 7+ (recommended: GCC 10+)
  - Clang 5+
  - MSVC 2017+
- **GNU Make** (or MinGW Make on Windows)

### Quick Build

#### 🪟 Windows (MinGW)

```bash
# Standard release build
mingw32-make

# Clean and rebuild
mingw32-make clean; mingw32-make all

# Build and run
mingw32-make run
```

#### 🐧 Linux

```bash
# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y g++ make

# Standard release build
make

# Clean and rebuild
make clean && make all
```

### Advanced Build Options (Windows)

```bash
# Debug build (no optimization, with symbols)
mingw32-make debug

# Build with PEXT/BMI2 support (Intel Haswell+, AMD Zen 3+)
mingw32-make pext

# Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) - Step 1: Generate profile
mingw32-make pgo-generate
# Run benchmarks: ./output/main.exe bench
# Step 2: Use profile data
mingw32-make pgo-use

# PEXT + PGO for maximum performance
mingw32-make pext-pgo-generate
# Run benchmarks: ./output/main.exe bench

echo "bench" | ./output/main.exe

# Run benchmark with custom settings
echo "bench 15 4 256" | ./output/main.exe  # depth 15, 4 threads, 256MB hash
```
